## Purpose
This document explains the concept of **GSAP ScrollTrigger**, a powerful plugin from the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) that allows you to trigger animations based on the user's scroll position. This plugin is widely used for creating engaging, scroll-driven animations in web development.

## What is ScrollTrigger?

**ScrollTrigger** is a GSAP plugin that allows you to create animations that are tied to the scrolling of the webpage. It enables animations to start when a specific element enters the viewport, or when the page is scrolled to a particular position. This creates dynamic, interactive web experiences.

## Key Features of ScrollTrigger

- **Scroll-based Triggers:** ScrollTrigger allows you to start and control animations when elements are scrolled into view.
- **Animation Control:** You can control how elements animate as the user scrolls, including smooth transitions, scaling, opacity changes, etc.
- **Scrubbing:** ScrollTrigger can scrub through animations, meaning the animation will play in sync with the scroll, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Markers (Debugging):** You can add markers to visualize when triggers occur during the scroll, which helps in debugging.
- **Pinning Elements:** You can "pin" elements in place while scrolling, which makes them stay in view during the scroll.
